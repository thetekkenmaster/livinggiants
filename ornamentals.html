		<h3>ORNAMENTALS</h3>
		<p>Have you ever stopped to marvel at a tree that caught your attention? If so, what was special about it? What color were the leaves or flowers? Did the tree have a fragrance? Also, what purpose did the tree serve in the landscape? Well, chances are that it was an ornamental tree. Ornamentals trees come from all over the world and are used to beautify the landscape. They can also add to the property value of businesses and residential areas.</p>
		<h4>FLOWERING TREES</h4>
		<span><img src="whiteFringe.jpg"><b>White Fringe</b></span>
		<p>Some of the most cherished trees are flowering ornamentals. It's not uncommon to find a few flowering trees in every yard. They're generally short and some of them can add seasonal beauty. A good example of such a tree is the Flowering Dogwood(at top of page). Flowering trees bloom at different times during spring. In fact, some trees like the Crape Myrtle bloom during summertime. Another benefit of flowering trees is the wonderful fragrances of the flowers. Also, they can attract butterflies and hummingbirds. Here's a list of common flowering trees.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Yoshino Cherry</li>
			<li>Saucer Magnolia</li>
			<li>Flowering Dogwood</li>
			<li>Redbud</li>
			<li>Hawthorne</li>
			<li>Serviceberry</li>
			<li>Southern Magnolia</li>
			<li>Bradford Pear</li>
			<li>Royal Empress</li>

		<h4>FALL FOLIAGE</h4>
		<span><img src="whiteAshAutumnPurple.jpg"><b>White Ash foliage</b></span>
		<p>Fall foliage is another reason we use trees as ornamentals. There's nothing more amazing than walking down a street lined up with trees that have purple, red, yellow, and orange foliage. There are numerous trees that produce wonderful fall colors. Another thing to know about these trees is that they're <i>deciduous</i>. Meaning that their leaves drop in the fall. In the next section I'll talk about another type of tree... The evergreen. But first, here are some common ornamental trees with briliant fall foliage.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sugar Maple</li>
			<li>Red Maple</li>
			<li>Japanese Maple</li>
			<li>Scarlet Oak</li>
			<li>American Sweetgum</li>
			<li>Mockernut Hickory</li>
			<li>Honeylocust</li>
			<li>Black Gum</li>
			<li>White Ash</li>
		</ul><br>
		<h4>EVERGREENS</h4>
		<span><img src="loblollyLongleaf.jpg"><b>Loblolly and Longleaf Pines</b></span>
		<p>Everygreens are trees that remain green year-round. They do still lose leaves but not at the same time. Evergreens play an important role in the design of the landscape. Because where is your color going to come from during those cold winter months? In winter, the deciduous trees generally look lifeless as the leaves have already fallen. Many everygreens are conifers. Conifers are trees that bare cones as their form of fruit. Here are some common evergreens...</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pine trees</li>
			<li>Spruce trees</li>
			<li>Fir trees</li>
			<li>Leyland Cypress</li>
			<li>Arborvitae</li>
			<li>Red Cedar</li>
